# Hands On Design, Modelling, Simulation(SPICE) and Prototyping of Discrete & Integrated Analog Circuits
This work involves hands-on design, modelling,  simulation and analysis (SPICE - MultiSim) of Discrete & Integrated Analog Circuits. Kind of activities involved in this work include:
- Understanding device structure and operating characteristics.
- Learn Circuit design modelling and analysis theory.
- Design and analyze circuits using pen-paper.
- Model and analyze circuits using simulation software (SPICE).
- Whenever possible, build circuits using real parts sourced from various vendors. Make measurement using real instruments and compare them with simulation results.

This is an ongoing work.

### Following is the bill of materials(BOM) of the list of parts used in various labs
- [LAOE-PE-PartsList.xlsx](https://github.com/varunnagpaal/Analog-Design-Modelling/blob/master/Parts/LAOE-PE-PartsList.xlsx)

The part numbers in the above BOM List above corresponds to Mouser specific part numbers. You may order parts from your country specific vendors(see Octopart BOM Tool)

### Notes
I do write lot of notes in notebook or on whiteboards. However, after a while I realized that sharing them becomes cumbersome and impractical.  So I decided to digitize my notes (not all though). Instead of pen & paper, I now write all my notes using Microsoft OneNote and XP-Pen Star 05 writing tablet . Below is link to my Microsoft OneNote on Analog circuits:
