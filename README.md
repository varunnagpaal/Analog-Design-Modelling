- [Digilent Real Analog Video Lectures](https://learn.digilentinc.com/classroom/realanalog/)

Idea is to build variety of circuits using real parts sourced from vendors and complement them with Multisim based SPICE Simulations. This is an ongoing work.

Following is the list of parts used in this project
